Tiny BASIC
==========

This latest version of Li-Chen Wang's Palo Alto Tiny BASIC will run on either the 8080 or Z-80, and only uses 2K of core memory. It contains a number of nice features including command abbreviations and error messages. At the end of the listing is a cross reference table for symbols used in the program and also the object code for the program. For further information on Tiny BASICs, see Dr. Dobb's Journal Volume 1 for which there is a card at the back. Tapes of version 1 are available from Community Computer Center (seep. 105).
